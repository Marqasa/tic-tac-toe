Play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, built using the React.js framework.

Tic-tac-toe or Noughts and Crosses is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
